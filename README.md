**Roles and Group Members**  

- Project Manager: David J. Cha (david.j.cha@stonybrook.edu)
- Lead Programmer: Daekyung Kim (daekyung.kim@stonybrook.edu)
- Product Owner: MSC (msc.sunykr@gmail.com)
- Designer: Haseung Lee (haseung.lee@stonybrook.edu)

**The Problem**  
The Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) at SUNY Korea has big and professional student clubs that are actively looking for growth beyond regular clubs. The Merchandising Society Club (MSC) is one of them, and MSC makes merchandise for FIT and Stony Brook University. They primarily focus on market and trend research, product development, visual merchandising, advertising, and sales planning. MSC also runs their own physical Retail Revolution Store at FIT, and they are currently in need of expanding their collection online. Particularly during the COVID 19 crisis, their offline store cannot be regularly accessed. Thus, having an online means of accessing MSC is a huge benefit for them.

**The Solution**  
Our solution is to create a website for them that will allow MSC to have an online platform that has several different sections such as an MSC about page, mailing subscriptions, an MSC product collection for showcasing merchandise, and a virtual showroom to replicate their physical Retail Revolution Store online.

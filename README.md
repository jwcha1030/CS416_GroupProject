**Roles and Group Members**  

- Project Manager: David J. Cha (david.j.cha@stonybrook.edu)
- Lead Programmer: Daekyung Kim (daekyung.kim@stonybrook.edu)
- Product Owner: MSC (msc.sunykr@gmail.com)

**The Problem**  
The Fashion Institue of Technology at SUNY Korea has big and professional student clubs that are actively looking for growth beyond regular school clubs. Merchandising Society Club (MSC) is one of them, and MSC makes merchandise for not only their institute but also other university campuses such as Stony Brook University. They primarily focus on market and trend research, product development, visual merchandising, advertising, and sales planning. MSC also runs their own physical Retail Revelution Store at FIT, and they are heavily in need of exapnding their collection and retails online. Particularly, during the COVID 19 situation, their offline store cannot be regularly accessed. Having an online means of accessing and visiting MSC is a huge benefit for them.

Thus, MSC would like an online platform, since their business is currently fully offline. Our solution is to create a website for them that will allow MSC to have an online platform that will include an about page, MSC members introduction, mailing subscriptions, MSC product collection, and a virtual showroom.

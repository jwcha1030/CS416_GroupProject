# Merchandising Society Club Website
**Purpose**
>The Merchandising Society Club wishes to create an online platform for their business. 
  	
**Roles and Group Members**  

>- Project Manager: David J. Cha (david.j.cha@stonybrook.edu)
>- Lead Programmer: Daekyung Kim (daekyung.kim@stonybrook.edu)
>- Product Owner: MSC (msc.sunykr@gmail.com)
>- Designer: Haseung Lee (haseung.lee@stonybrook.edu)

**The Problem**  
>The Merchandising Society Club (MSC) makes Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) and Stony Brook University merchandise. Their goal is to not only produce merchandise for >students and faculties but also to showcase and sell their products that are crafted after extensive research on fashion trends and sales planning. Thus, to display their >products for sale, MSC runs its own physical Retail Revolution Store at FIT, and they are currently in need of expanding their collection online. Particularly during the COVID >19 crisis, customers cannot regularly access the offline retail store. Thus, having an online means of accessing MSC is a massive benefit for them. 

**The Solution**  
>Our solution is to create a flexible website for MSC that will allow them to manage and maintain an online platform that has several different sections which include an MSC >about page, mailing subscriptions, an MSC product collection for showcasing merchandise, and a virtual showroom to replicate their physical Retail Revolution Store online.

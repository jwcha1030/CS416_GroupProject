# Merchandising Society Club Website

> Purpose: The Merchandising Society Club wishes to create an online platform for their business. 
  	
**Roles and Group Members**  

- Project Manager: David J. Cha (david.j.cha@stonybrook.edu)
- Lead Programmer: Daekyung Kim (daekyung.kim@stonybrook.edu)
- Product Owner: MSC (msc.sunykr@gmail.com)
- Designer: Haseung Lee (haseung.lee@stonybrook.edu)

**The Problem**  
MSC would like an online platform, since their business is currently fully offline.  
Our solution is to create a website for them that will allow MSC to have an online platform that will include an about page, MSC members introduction, mailing subscriptions, and a virtual showroom.
